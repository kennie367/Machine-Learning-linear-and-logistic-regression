I have used the churn data set to create a logistic regression model and be able to prodict if a customer will exit a bank based on some factors such as
CreditScore	
Geography	
Gender	
Age	
Tenure	
Balance	
NumOfProducts	
HasCrCard
IsActiveMember	
EstimatedSalary
The outcome of the model was
Accuracy: 0.792
Precision: 0.4827586206896552
Recall: 0.06763285024154589
F1 score: 0.11864406779661016
